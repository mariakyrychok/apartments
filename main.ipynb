    "- `airports_nearest` — distance to the nearest airport in meters (m)\n",
    "- `balcony` — number of balconies\n",
    "- `ceiling_height` — ceiling height in meters (m)\n",
    "- `cityCenters_nearest` — distance to the city center in meters (m)\n",
    "- `days_exposition` — number of days the advertisement was active (from publication to withdrawal)\n",
    "- `first_day_exposition` — publication date\n",
    "- `floor` — floor\n",
    "- `floors_total` — total number of floors in the building\n",
    "- `is_apartment` — apartment (boolean type)\n",
    "- `kitchen_area` — kitchen area in square meters (m²)\n",
    "- `last_price` — price at the time of withdrawal from publication\n",
    "- `living_area` — living area in square meters (m²)\n",
    "- `locality_name` — locality name\n",
    "- `open_plan` — open plan (boolean type)\n",
    "- `parks_around3000` — number of parks within a 3 km radius\n",
    "- `parks_nearest` — distance to the nearest park (m)\n",
    "- `ponds_around3000` — number of ponds within a 3 km radius\n",
    "- `ponds_nearest` — distance to the nearest pond (m)\n",
    "- `rooms` — number of rooms\n",
    "- `studio` — studio apartment (boolean type)\n",
    "- `total_area` — total area of the apartment in square meters (m²)\n",
    "- `total_images` — number of photos of the apartment in the listing\n",
    "\n",
    "Only 8 columns have no missing values: `total_images`, `last_price`, `total_area`, `first_day_exposition`, `rooms`, `floor`, `studio`, `open_plan`. In columns such as `is_apartment`, `park_nearest`, `ponds_nearest`, there are the most missing values.\n",

    "For half of the columns, the data type does not match reality. Columns like `floor_total`, `balcony`, `parks_around300`, `ponds_around3000`, `days_exposition` have a `float64` data type, although by nature, they should strictly be `int64`. Data in columns `airports_nearest`, `cityCenters_nearest`, `park_nearest`, and `ponds_nearest` may be floating-point numbers, but for convenience, it is advisable to change their type from `float64` to `int64`, especially since it will not affect the research results. The column `first_day_exposition` has an `object` type, which does not correspond to reality and should be `datatime64`. Similarly, the data type of the `is_apartment` column contradicts its nature, so it should be changed from `object` to `bool`.\n",

    "We have investigated real estate listings for apartments in St. Petersburg and its surroundings. We found that the following factors have the most significant impact on the apartment price:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total area of the apartment (correlation coefficient varies from 0.68 to 0.79 depending on the sample)\n",
    "- Number of rooms (correlation coefficient ~0.4)\n",
    "- Distance from the city center (correlation coefficient from -0.12 to -0.32, with an increase in distance from the center, the price decreases)\n",
    "- Ceiling height (weak correlation in the range of 0.15–0.2)\n",
    "- The floor has a slight impact, especially in the center of St. Petersburg (correlation coefficient 0.2)\n",
    "\n",
    "The apartment price is not influenced by the day of the week, month, or year of publication. Although we discovered an interesting pattern that over the years, the total area of the sold apartments decreases, while the price per square meter increases."
